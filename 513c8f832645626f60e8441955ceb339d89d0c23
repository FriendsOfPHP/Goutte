That's not needed as per the HTTP spec. Do you have a specific need to make this change?

If second word in lowercase then `isset($contentHeaders['Content-Type']) === false`

In other words, the second condition is never satisfied

I understand now. So, instead of this change, I would prefer to remove the proper capitalization done for the key but apparently, Guzzle is case sensitive for HTTP headers (which is a bug :))

No, Guzzle is not case sensitive for HTTP headers
